title=Departments-app
welcome.msg=Here's an application I made. There are two main pages, one for client build with use of jQuery interacting with REST service and one build with RestTemplate and jsp. I plan on adding an angularJS and ReactJS client pages in future.
search.explanation=Search works regardless of whether you selected dates. If inputs are empty, the query retrieves data without any search conditions, essentially giving whole employee list. If only one of the dates is entered, search query retrieves entries by strictly comparing date of birth of employee with date in search query. If both dates were entered, query retrieves all employee dates of birth of whom fall within the dates interval, including dates themselves.
jsp.title=This page was built with jsp and RestTemplate in services.
jq.title=This page was built with jQuery.
